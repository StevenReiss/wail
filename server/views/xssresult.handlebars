	  <P>
This lesson shows you how simple it is for an intruder to use Cross Site Scripting
(XSS) to redirect the browser to a different page.
<P>
Here you are given a sample page.  Its URL is '/lesson/xsslesson/action/showpage'.
Your job is to cause the page '/lesson/xsslesson/action/altpage' to appear in its
place.	This alternate page is a duplicate of the page except it could have been on
a hacker's web site and could capture private information the user enters and pass
it to the hacker instead of the original application.
<P>
You are asked to enter your name and some information.	You will note that the
name you enter is then placed in the page when you click on 'Try It'.  The contents
of the name are not checked for embedded HTML.
