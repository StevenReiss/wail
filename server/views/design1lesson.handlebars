                Early on, Remy became frustrated in his quest to open a fancy french
restaurant and decided it would be easier to create an on-line Pasta Parlor instead.  However, while
he has no problem creating his own pasta and sauces, he doesn't know how to create an attractive web
page that would be easy to use and effective for his on-line efforts.  You have been chosen to show
him how.  You should create an ordering page.  The customer should be able to use the page to create
their own pasta dish which will then be made to order.  Customers should be able to choose among different types
of pasta (e.g. spaghetti, macaroni, rigatoni, ravioli, tagliatelle, penne, ...), different types of sauces 
(e.g. pesto, alfredo, marinara, vodka, arabbiata, ...), and different types of toppings (e.g. sausage, meatballs,
veggie balls, baby mozzarella, tomatos, peppers, shrimp, ...).

Your job is to sketch out a web (or mobile) page for this purpose.  This can be done on paper or you can use a tool 
such as adobe XD, figma, photoshop, etc.  But you only have a limited amount of time (5-10 minutes), so 
we are looking for just an outline of what you are thinking of.             
        </P>
        <P>
 When you are done you should upload your design.  If you use paper, then take a picture (or scan it) to
 produce an appropriate image.  Designs can be uploaded as images or pdf files.
